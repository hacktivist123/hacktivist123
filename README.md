I love to [write](https://sheddy.xyz), code, and [teach](https://sheddy.xyz/pages/talks).

I'm trying to embrace constant learning, growing and I'm currently working towards becoming a better version of myself.

I currently do Developer Advocacy 🥑 things at [Cloud Foundry Foundation](https://cloudfoundry.org) and it's a really fun job.

These days, I'm quite interested in developer experience, Javascript Build tools and also Cloud Native Tech😄

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Cloud Native Technologies(Cloud Foundry, k8s)
- 💬 Ask me about Javascript, Technical Writing, Developer Advocacy, Music 😉
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can't touch my toes while standing 😆
